LittleLemon App is a delivery application developed during the Meta Android Developer course. The app's user interface was built using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. Throughout the development, various Jetpack Compose features were explored to create a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

## Features

The LittleLemon App showcases several essential Jetpack Compose features:

- **NavController**: NavController was utilized to manage the navigation flow within the app. With this feature, users can seamlessly move between different screens, such as the home page, product categories, shopping cart, and checkout.

- **Lists**: The app utilizes Jetpack Compose's List function to display product listings, making it easy for users to browse through available items.

- **LazyColumn**: LazyColumn is implemented to handle the efficient rendering of large lists of items. It loads data and composes only the visible items on the screen, optimizing performance and memory usage.

- **MaterialTheme**: Jetpack Compose's MaterialTheme was used to ensure consistent and visually appealing design elements throughout the app. This helped maintain a cohesive user experience and adhered to material design principles.
